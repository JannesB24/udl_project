# Code Setup
We strongly recommend a Linux based system. If you are using Windows consider [installing WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/de-de/windows/wsl/install) to use a Linux subsystem on Windows. We suggest using the latest Ubuntu.

✅ Make should come pre-installed.

🛠️ Install `uv` using [pipx as described in the official documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#pypi).
